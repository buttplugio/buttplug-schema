# Buttplug Message Format JSON Schema

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/metafetish/buttplug-schema.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/metafetish/buttplug-schema)

This repo houses the central json schema for the Buttplug Sex Toy
Control Server Protocol.

The JSON Schema for the Buttplug Message format is available in the
'schema' directory. This is the central source of truth for
communicating with Buttplug clients and servers. The goal is to only
update and not remove messages, but as with all protocols, this goal
may be more of a dream than a reality. We'll be abiding by semantic
versioning rules, with major version changes only on breaking changes
to the schema.

More information on Buttplug and the hardware it supports can be found
at [https://buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io).
